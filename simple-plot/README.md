# Simple Plot

## Introduction
I've been struggling with this lib for far too long. So, I decided to create a git repository with (kinda) all my "plot" annotations for all the hopeless Python programmers souls that really want to start developing in ReactJS but struggle with this language.

Using Windows 10 Pro - 64 bits.

## Installing Plotly.js in ReactJS
Install via command line:

    npm install react-plotly.js plotly.js

If there is any problem in installation try reading the errors in command line or using administrator mode.
